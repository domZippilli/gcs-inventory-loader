# This is a mapping of storage classes understood by this program to storage
# classes which may be encountered when describing blobs. In general,
# the blob API will use more verbose names, or a handful of legacy names.
# See https://googleapis.dev/python/storage/latest/blobs.html#google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob.storage_class  # noqa: E501
# for more information about the storage class names used by
# Blob.storage_class.
# The storage class names used by this program are also included in the
# mapping, so this can be used with storage class descriptions from other
# sources, like the catchup table.
